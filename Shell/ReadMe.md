This repository contains the code for the shell lab. The 
purpose is to have a simple shell that can execute basic commands as 
well as piping and redirecting. 

The primary shell program is named shellLab. The basic structure of my solution is to have the main program 
loop through the cmds provided and call what programs it needs. The program p3-exec is used for executing basic
commands using a parent and child. While the program piping.py handles piping, and the program p4-redirect is for 
redirecting input/output. 
  
To call the shell do the following: `python3 shellLab.py `
